# Data
We have three datasets for three different regions, each with tree features.

* id: unique oil well identifier
* f0, f1, f2: three features of points (their specific meaning is unimportant, but the features themselves are significant)
* product: volume of reserves in the oil well (thousand barrels)

# Description
Create a model that helps pick the region with the highest profit margin.
