| Bank loans                | Create a report to evaluate the users credit behaviour.                                                                                               |
| Vehicles pricing          | Study the data regarding car listings and see which fields affect more the final price.                                                               |
| Telecomm users analysis   | Analyze user behaviour and rule which plan is more profitable.                                                                                        |
| Game sales                | Identify patterns to see if a game is gonna be a sales success to predict promising projects.                                                         |
| Taxi trips                | Do a data exploratory analysis and test the hypothesis that average trip duration on the aiport changes when rainy and saturday.                      |
| Telecomm users behaviours | Develop several models to predict the best plan for users.                                                                                            |
| Bank churn                | Develop several models to predict the best plan for users.                                                                                            |
| Oil wells model           | Create a model that helps pick the region with the highest profit margin.                                                                             |
| Gold ore extraction       | Prepare a machine learning model that helps predict the amount of gold extracted from gold ore.                                                       |
| Insurance data            | Identify if users are gonna use their benefits with KNN and linear regression models.                                                                 |
| Car data value            | Create a model that is able to predit the price of the listing. Models used: random forest, linear regression, LightGBM and CatBoost.                 |
| Taxi service time series  | Use timeseries to understand the trends and seasonality of the data, and train models with the user info.                                             |
| Movie reviews modelling   | Build several models to classificate the text reviews.                                                                                                |
| Age recognition with CV   | Train a computer vision to indentify different users age.                                                                                             |
| Final project: churn data | Analyze the churn data for a telecommunications company and produce an EDA. Train several models and choose one to get a ROC-AUC and Accuracy > 0.90. |
